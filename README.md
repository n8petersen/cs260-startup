I learned that with Git Conflict resolution, there are several ways to make the merge. You can either accept changes from one commit, or the other, or a combination, or you can manually resolve the conflicts by just typing in what you want the result to be, which is what I did. I changed the two lines `another modification from GitHub.` and `another modification from VSCode.` and manually resolved it to be `another modification from GitHub and VSCode.`
