# Checker
## Design
This is a simple website that will enable a user to create check lists for any occasion, whether it be a to-do List, a shopping list, etc. Each list can be shared with other registered users on the website. The tasks can have a title, a due date/time, and a description. There will be multiple ways to sort the lists: Custom sort by dragging the tasks, Sort by Due Date/Time, Filter completed.
